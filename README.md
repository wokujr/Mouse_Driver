# mouse_driver

This is a previous project of mine that involved using the OpenCV library for image detection in Valorant. The objective was to automatically move the mouse to the target based on color. The code was primarily written in Python and integrated with Arduino for basic bypassing functionalities. While this project is not yet perfect, I thoroughly enjoyed the learning journey of creating a simple AI system that aids in accurate aiming at the target.
